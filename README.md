## Environment Setup (Recommended: Use GitHub Codespaces)

For the easiest setup, use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Codespaces provides a pre-configured development environment with Ruby and Bundler already installed, so development and serving the site can begin immediately. The `bundle` command is available out of the box.

To build and run this Jekyll site locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) are installed.
2. Install the required gems:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Serve the site locally:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view the site.
